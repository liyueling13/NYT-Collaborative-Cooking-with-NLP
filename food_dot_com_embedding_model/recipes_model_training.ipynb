    "# Sentiment Analysis via food.com Word Embedding\n",
    "In this notebook, we load in a word embedding and sentiment analyzer which are both trained specifically on food.com reviews to predict sentiments on reviews for the NYT Salted Tahini Chocolate Chip Cookies recipe (https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1018055-salted-tahini-chocolate-chip-cookies). Our hypothesis is that this would produce a better accuracy that using a generic word embedding and/or sentiment analyzer. \n",

      " Actual comment:  This was awesome and well worth the wait in the fridge. I scooped prior to chilling and it was way easier than chilled dough. I used Soom tahini which is seriously the best brand ever. Only other change was I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead of all white sugar. Not sure how much difference that makes but I wanted soft chewy cookies and I got it.\n",
